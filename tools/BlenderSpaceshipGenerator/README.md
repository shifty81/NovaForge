# BlenderSpaceshipGenerator

A comprehensive Blender addon for procedurally generating spaceships with modular parts and interiors. Inspired by games like X4 Foundations, Elite Dangerous, and Eve Online.

Built as the ship generator for the [Nova Forge](https://github.com/shifty81/EVEOFFLINE) project — a PVE space simulator powered by the custom Atlas Engine and Atlas UI.

## Nova Forge / Atlas Integration

This addon integrates directly with the Nova Forge project:

- **Import ships from Nova Forge JSON** — reads `data/ships/*.json` and generates matching geometry using each ship's faction, class, seed, and hardpoint data.
- **Export OBJ for Atlas Engine** — one-click export with correct axis orientation for the Atlas rendering pipeline.
- **Four faction styles** — Solari (elegant), Veyren (angular), Aurelian (organic), Keldari (rugged) map directly to Nova Forge's four factions.
- **All ship classes** — Frigates through Titans, plus Industrials, Mining Barges, and Exhumers.
- **Station generation** — procedural space stations matching Nova Forge station types (Industrial, Military, Commercial, Research, Mining) and Upwell structures (Astrahus, Fortizar, Keepstar).
- **Asteroid belt generation** — procedural asteroid belts with all 16 Nova Forge ore types and 4 belt layouts (Semicircle, Sphere, Cluster, Ring).

  - Cockpit/Bridge appropriate to ship size
  - Multiple engine configurations
  - Wing structures for smaller vessels
  - Weapon hardpoints
  - Progressive module system for ship expansion

- **Brick Taxonomy & LEGO Logic**:
  - 18 brick types across 5 categories (Core, Hull, Function, Utility, Detail)
  - Hardpoint declarations on every brick for snap-attach rules
  - Scale hierarchy bands (primary, structural, detail)
  - Grid snapping per ship class (0.5 m for shuttles up to 8 m for titans)
  - Ship DNA JSON export for reproducible/saveable ships

- **Spine-First Assembly Pipeline**:
  1. Core hull (spine)
  2. Cockpit / bridge
  3. Major structures (wings)
  4. Engines (archetype-varied)
  5. Weapons & turrets
  6. Detail modules
  7. Interior (optional)
  8. Hull taper / deform pass
  9. Bevel + auto-smooth cleanup pass

- **Engine Archetypes**:
  - Main Thrust — big, recessed, with nozzle flare
  - Maneuvering Thrusters — small, angled
  - Utility Exhaust — flat vents
  - Each archetype varies depth, radius, glow strength

- **Hull Shaping**:
  - Configurable hull taper for silhouette shaping
  - Automatic bevel + auto-smooth cleanup pass
  - Style-specific hull deformations (X4, Elite, EVE, NMS, factions)

- **Interior Generation**:
  - FPV-ready interiors scaled for human exploration
  - Corridor networks connecting ship areas
  - Bridge/cockpit interiors
  - Crew quarters with bunks
  - Cargo bays with containers
  - Engine rooms with reactor cores
  - Doorways and access points

- **Module System**:
  - Cargo modules
  - Weapon modules
  - Shield generators
  - Hangar bays
  - Sensor arrays
  - Power modules

- **Design Styles**:
  - X4 Foundations (Angular, geometric)
  - Elite Dangerous (Sleek, aerodynamic)
  - Eve Online (Organic, flowing)
  - Mixed (Combination of all styles)
  - **Nova Forge Factions**:
    - Solari (Golden, elegant — armor tanking)
    - Veyren (Angular, utilitarian — shield tanking)
    - Aurelian (Sleek, organic — drones)
    - Keldari (Rugged, industrial — missiles)

- **Station Generation**:
  - NPC station types: Industrial, Military, Commercial, Research, Mining
  - Upwell structures: Astrahus, Fortizar, Keepstar
  - Faction-specific architecture (spires, domes, blocks, scaffolding)
  - Docking bays and hangars

- **Asteroid Belt Generation**:
  - 16 ore types from Nova Forge (Dustite through Nexorite)
  - 4 belt layouts: Semicircle, Sphere, Cluster, Ring
  - Procedural deformation for natural rocky shapes
  - PBR materials matching ore visual data

## Ship Classes

### Small Vessels
- **Shuttle**: Basic transport, 2 crew, minimal weapons
- **Fighter**: Single-seat combat, agile with wings
- **Corvette**: Small multi-crew, 4 crew, basic modules

### Medium Vessels
- **Frigate**: Multi-role ship, 10 crew, interior corridors
- **Destroyer**: Heavy combat focus, 25 crew, full interior
- **Industrial**: Cargo hauler, 5 crew, large hold

## Progressive Module System

Ships can be expanded with additional modules based on their class:
- Small ships: Weapon, Shield, Sensor modules
- Medium ships: Also Cargo and Power modules
- Large ships: All module types including Hangar modules

Each module is automatically placed and connected to the ship with appropriate details.

All ship interiors are built to human scale for FPV exploration:
- Standard door height: 2.0m
- Corridor width: 1.5m
- Room height: 3.0m
- All dimensions support first-person navigation

## Customization

The addon supports extensive customization:
- **Random Seed**: Change to generate different ship variations
- **Hull Complexity**: Adjust geometry detail (0.1 - 3.0)
- **Module Slots**: Add 0-10 additional modules
- **Symmetry**: Toggle symmetrical design
- **Style**: Choose specific design inspiration or mixed

## Requirements
