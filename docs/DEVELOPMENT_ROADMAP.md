# Atlas Engine — Locked-In Development Roadmap

> **Source of truth**: Derived from `features1.md` (canonical project bible).
> This document defines the locked-in development path for Nova Forge built on the Atlas Engine.
> All new work must align with this roadmap. No feature ships unless it passes the design enforcement rules below.

---

## Design Enforcement Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Every new system or feature **must** pass all three checks:

1. **Atlas-fit** — Does it belong naturally inside Atlas Engine?
2. **Simulation-first** — Does it work without UI, audio, or player input?
3. **Lore-consistent** — Would captains in-universe believe this exists?

If it fails any one → it doesn't ship.

## Architecture Pillars

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Server (Authoritative)** | Tick-based simulation, ECS, AI, economy, combat, persistence |
| **Client (Display)** | Rendering, interpolation, UI, input, audio — no game logic authority |
| **Networking** | Server sends snapshots → Client caches → Interpolation → Render |

- **Tick-based simulation** (10–20 Hz), deterministic for networking and replays
- **Atlas Engine & Atlas UI exclusively** — all systems are Atlas-native
- **No ImGui for game UI** — retained only for debug/dev tools

---

## Naming Conventions

| Scope | Prefix | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Engine-wide | `Atlas` | `AtlasDeterministicScheduler` |
| Simulation (headless) | `Sim` | `SimFleetMoraleComponent` |
| Rendering | `AtlasRender` | `AtlasRenderTacticalOverlay` |
| UI | `UI_` | `UI_TacticalOverlayRing` |
| Game-specific | `EVO_` | `EVO_PirateCoalitionDoctrine` |

**Forbidden:** Generic names (`Manager`, `Controller`, `Handler`), engine-agnostic names (`InventorySystem`, `AIController`).

- **Components** = pure data, no logic, serializable
- **Systems** = stateless logic processors, deterministic, scheduled by Atlas ECS

---

### Phase 1: Core Fleet (v0.1–v0.2)
> Player + small fleet, captain personalities, basic flight & combat.

- [x] Fleet system: player + up to 4 captains (max 5 ships)
- [x] `SimCaptainPsychologyComponent` (loyalty, aggression, paranoia, ambition)

  - Shader layers: radial distortion, starfield velocity bloom, tunnel skin, vignette
  - Adaptive audio: engine core (sub-bass), warp field harmonics, environmental shimmer
  - Dynamic intensity based on ship mass
  - Accessibility controls (motion, bass, blur intensity)

### Phase 2: Living Universe (v0.2)
> The universe moves without the player. NPCs are real actors.

**Goal:** A universe that reacts over time and remembers player impact.

#### Core Systems
- [x] `SimStarSystemStateComponent` — per-system state vector (traffic, economy, security, threat, faction influence)
- [x] `AtlasBackgroundSimulationSystem` — continuous background simulation tick
- [x] Threshold-based system events (pirate surge, shortages, lockdowns)
- [ ] Local reputation per system

#### NPC Life
- [x] Intent-driven NPC AI (`SimNPCIntentComponent`)
  - Intents: Trade, Patrol, Hunt, Explore, Flee, Escort, Salvage
  - Intent scoring: `NPCIntent ChooseIntent(NPC& npc, StarSystemState& sys)`
- [x] NPC archetypes: Trader, Pirate, Patrol, Miner, Hauler, Industrialist
- [ ] NPC behavior trees (per archetype)
- [ ] NPC rerouting based on system danger
- [ ] Ambient traffic spawns driven by system state
- [ ] AI as real economic actors (wallets, ship ownership, permanent death)

#### Combat Aftermath
- [ ] Wreck persistence
- [ ] Salvage NPCs
- [ ] Security response delay
- [ ] System threat adjustment from combat

#### World Feedback
- [ ] Station news feed
- [ ] Rumors about player actions (`AtlasInformationPropagationSystem`)
- [ ] Visual cues (lockdowns, traffic density)

#### Economy Engine
- [ ] No fake NPC market orders — everything produced, transported, consumed, destroyed
- [ ] Regional markets with delayed information
- [ ] Dynamic taxation and broker fees
- [ ] Supply/demand curves driven by NPC activity
- [ ] `AtlasEconomicFlowSystem`

### Phase 3: Wing System & Midgame (v0.3)
> Expand fleet to 15 ships, wing roles, deeper fleet psychology.

- [ ] Wing system: 3 wings × 5 ships
- [ ] Wing commanders with decision authority
- [ ] Wing roles: Mining, Combat, Logistics
- [ ] Wing-level morale
- [ ] Wing chatter overrides individual chatter
- [ ] Commander disagreement system
- [ ] `AtlasFleetDoctrineSystem`
- [ ] Tactical Overlay (`AtlasSpatialProjectionSystem`)
  - Passive 2.5D spatial overlay
  - Truthful distances and positioning
  - Shared filtering with Overview
  - Non-interactive (read-only)
- [ ] Overview panel with entity filtering
- [ ] Imperfect information system (scan confidence ranges, intel decay)
- [ ] Captain backgrounds (former miner, ex-military, etc.)

### Phase 4: Full Fleet Doctrine & Endgame (v0.4+)
> 25 ships, 5 wings, philosophical fractures, civilization-scale gameplay.

- [ ] Full fleet: 5 wings × 5 ships (25 total)
- [ ] Doctrine slots: Mining/Salvage, Logistics/Repair, Escort, Construction
- [ ] Fleet ideology system — captains with philosophical alignment
- [ ] Fleet fracture mechanics (disagreement → potential departure)
- [ ] `AtlasFleetMoraleResolutionSystem`
- [ ] Mobile industry and logistics
- [ ] Fleet cargo pooling (civilization-scale inventory)
- [ ] `AtlasPersistenceDeltaSystem` — long-term consequence tracking

### Phase 5: Titan Systems & Meta-Threat (v0.5+)
> Galactic-scale emergent threats. Titans are processes, not spawns.

- [ ] `SimTitanAssemblyProgressComponent` — progress, secrecy, resource pressure
- [ ] `AtlasTitanAssemblyPressureSystem` — pirate resources → assembly progress
- [ ] `AtlasOuterRimLogisticsDistortionSystem` — trade route distortion
- [ ] `AtlasRumorPropagationSystem` — incomplete intel leaks
- [ ] `AtlasGalacticResponseCurveSystem` — AI faction response escalation
- [ ] Warp anomalies & rare mid-warp events
  - Visual-only phenomena (common)
  - Sensory distortions (uncommon)
  - Spacetime shear events (rare, memorable)
  - Legendary warp events (ultra-rare, screenshot-worthy)
- [ ] Pirate coalition doctrine
- [ ] Evidence-based player discovery (no UI reveals)
- [ ] Galactic response curves (empire reinforcement, trade rerouting)
